He lived in Flanders from 1781 until 1790 and began in 1793/94 to buy pictures in the Low Countries that he imported to London.  In 1798 he was instrumental in the purchase of the Orleans collection and for many years he was the principal agent through whom individual Orleans pictures were sold in England.  He also imported a large number of important paintings from the Robit collection in Paris in 1801.  A large sale of his pictures took place under the direction of Coxe, Burrell & Foster in 1798, and many of these pictures reappear at later sales.  Shortly afterward he established his own gallery at No.88 Pall Mall where he held his own sales, normally by private contract rather than by auction.  He also put pictures into sales at Christie's, and is often recorded as a buyer.  He seems to have held some pictures over long periods of time, and his stock must have been large.  In 1804 (May 7/10) Coxe, Burrell & Foster held an extended sale of over 300 of Bryan's pictures in Bryan's own rooms and the catalogue declared that he was closing the gallery.  The premises thereafter belonged to Coxe, and Bryan retired to the country and supposedly ceased dealing.  However, sales of his possessions took place in 1810 and at his death in 1821.  Bryan was also the compiler of one of the most important artists biographical dictionaries; it first appeared in 1813 and was republished at various times throughout the century.  He was considered one of the best connoisseurs of his time.","","","Farington (June 19, 1809) says he had been declared bankrupt.
