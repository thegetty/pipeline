(The first was held on Apr.30, no.1511 and the second on May 6, no.1516.)  As is the case with the earlier sales, none of the extant copies of the catalogue is annotated with the names of the sellers, but a list included by the auctioneer shows how the proceeds were divided among the consigners.  Once more the list consists entirely of minor dealers, among whom Spackman and Hawkins are the principal consigners.  It is unlikely that any of them were artists.  The results were also much the same; the prices were generally low, and only three lots sold for more than £3. (B. Fredericksen)","yes","CATALOGUES-1373","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[handschriftliche Liste] Kommentar: Es handelt sich um einen Lotterieverkauf, der 1765 von dem Maler Johann Andreas Benjamin Nothnagel (1729-1804) organisiert worden war. Nothnagel lebte seit 1747 in Frankfurt, um dort in der Tapetenfabrik von Johann Gabriel Kiesewetter und Johann Nikolaus Lentzner zu arbeiten. Nach dem Tod von Lentzner heiratete Nothnagel dessen Witwe und wurde Teilhaber der Firma, die er dann von 1753 an allein führte. Die Kaiserliche privilegierte Nothnagelsche Fabrik entwickelte sich zu einem international renommierten Betrieb. Neben der Tapetenfabrikation baute Nothnagel eine Kunsthandlung auf. In den Jahren 1779 und 1784 führte er noch zwei weitere Auktionen durch (Kat. A125 und 152). Nothnagels eigene Sammlung wurde nach seinem Tod 1818 in Frankfurt versteigert (Lugt 9426).  Insgesamt wurden für diese Lotterie 489 Lose verkauft, die jeweils 4 Gulden und 30 Kreuzer kosteten. Der Wert jeden Loses betrug 4 Gulden 18 Kreuzer, die Differenz wurde zur Begleichung verschiedener Unkosten verwendet. Als Gewinne wurden 163 Gemälde zusammengestellt, die einen Gesamtwert von 2.099 Gulden ausmachten. Die Bilderpreise wurden in einer handschriftlichen tabellarischen Liste aufgeführt und unterschiedlichen Wertkategorien zugeordnet. Als erster Preis war ein Bild von Johann Georg Trautmann ausgeschrieben, das mit 100 Gulden angesetzt wurde. Als zweiten Preis bestimmte Nothnagel zwei Jagdstücke von einem Vertreter der Malerfamilie Querfurth, die zusammen auf 80 Gulden eingeschätzt wurden. Der dritte Preis waren zwei Geflügelstücke von Jakob Samuel Beck zu einem Schätzpreis von 60 Gulden. Für die übrigen Gemälde bestimmte Nothnagel Werte, die zwischen 6 und 500 Gulden je Bild lagen, wobei in die billigste Kategorie allein 65 Bilder fielen. Bei den als Preisen angesetzten Gemälden handelt es sich überwiegend um Werke zeitgenössischer Künstler aus dem Frankfurter Raum.
