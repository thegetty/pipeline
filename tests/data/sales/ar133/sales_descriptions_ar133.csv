(The first was held on Apr.30, no.1511 and the second on May 6, no.1516.)  As is the case with the earlier sales, none of the extant copies of the catalogue is annotated with the names of the sellers, but a list included by the auctioneer shows how the proceeds were divided among the consigners.  Once more the list consists entirely of minor dealers, among whom Spackman and Hawkins are the principal consigners.  It is unlikely that any of them were artists.  The results were also much the same; the prices were generally low, and only three lots sold for more than £3. (B. Fredericksen)",yes,CATALOGUES-1373,,,,,,,,,,,,
