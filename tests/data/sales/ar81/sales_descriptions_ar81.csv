The title page of the catalogue carries the year 1804, but no month or date is given.  However, the sale can probably be connected with an announcement in the Morning Chronicle on June 11, 1804, for an anonymous sale in Bryan's gallery of special pictures.  Since Bryan apparently sold his gallery in May of this year -- after which time it was called late Mr. Bryan's -- the present sale must have taken place after May.  No other announcements for an anonymous sale by private contract to be held in this gallery are known, and so we have assigned the date of June 11 to it.  Its duration is unknown. The printed catalogue does not provide any information about the owner, but the single extant copy is inscribed with the name Parke.  Because many of the pictures reappear in the dealer John Parke's sale of 1812, it is likely that everything in the current sale was his.  A few pictures can perhaps be traced to Michael Bryan, but they had probably been bought by Parke prior to the sale.  A significant number of the pictures also reappear in the Heathcote sale of Apr.5/6, 1805 (no.322), but since they also reappear in Parke's sale of 1812, it is fairly certain that they were his property throughout. As was characteristic of many sales by private contract, the descriptions of the individual pictures in the catalogue are exceedingly brief, with very little information about provenance.  However, a number of the pictures certainly came from the Robit and Gildemeester collections, and it can be assumed that many were of good quality.  Two have been identified:  lot 18, A Landscape with Abraham and Isaac by Domenichino, said to have come from the Orléans collection, is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; and lot 36, A Portrait of a Member of the Barbarini Family by Titian, is certainly the painting now in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, currently -- and erroneously -- attributed to Willem Key.  However, most of the paintings in the sale seem not to have been sold, since they subsequently appeared at auctions to which Parke was still their consigner.  (B.

Kommentar: In diesem umfangreichen Katalog wurde die Sammlung von Johann Heinrich von Gise (auch Giese geschrieben) versteigert, der am Hof des Kurfürsten Clemens August (1700-1761) als Leibarzt diente (vgl. ADu, Akte Kurköln II 491, Bl. 2-5). Clemens August war 1723 zum Kurfürsten und Erzbischof von Köln ernannt worden und entfaltete als Mäzen der Künste ein aufwendiges Hofleben. In seinem Umkreis wurden auch zahlreiche Hofbeamte zu Kunstsammlern, zu denen auch Gise zählte. Als Termin für die Versteigerung wurde der 1. August angesetzt, worauf in einer Nachbemerkung am Ende des Katalogs hingewiesen wird. Der Versteigerungskatalog umfaßt 624 Losnummern für Gemälde sowie einige Skulpturen. Unter den ersten 100 Nummern werden teilweise mehrere Bilder unter einem Los verzeichnet. In sprachlicher Hinsicht haben die Einträge den Charakter von Inventareinträgen. Es fehlen Maßangaben, und die Bildtitel sind sehr knapp gehalten. In der Reihenfolge der Lose läßt sich keinerlei Ordnung erkennen. Bei den meisten Einträgen wird klar zwischen Original, Schulbild und Kopie unterschieden. Auch bei den anonymen Gemälden wird ausdrücklich darauf hingewiesen, daß es sich um Originale handelt. Auffallend ist die verdeutschte Schreibweise zahlreicher Künstlernamen, wie beispielsweise Rheinbrand, Hemskirchen, Thenthoretto. Unter den 690 Gemälden finden sich rund 250 Arbeiten holländischer und flämischer Künstler des 17. und 18. Jahrhunderts, darunter neun Werke Rembrandts und 31 Bilder aus dem Van-Dyck-Umkreis. Mit insgesamt über hundert Werken sind auch die italienischen Schulen stark repräsentiert, während deutsche Künstler nur mit 60 Gemälden vertreten sind. Vermutlich ist die Auktion erfolglos verlaufen oder gar ganz verschoben worden, denn am 30. August fand erneut eine Versteigerung statt, von der sich ein französischsprachiger Katalog erhalten hat (Kat. A14a), in dem immerhin noch 398 Gemälde sowie rund 100 summarisch zusammengefaßte Gemälde aufgeführt werden. Zahlreiche Bilder wurden vom Kurfürsten Clemens August schon bei dieser oder aber bei der zweiten Auktion am Ende des Monats erworben und tauchen in der Versteigerung seines Nachlasses 1764 wieder auf. Darunter befand sich beispielsweise auch der Verlorene Sohn von Rembrandt (Nr. 37 in Kat. A14; Nr. 770 in Kat. A45). Dieses Bild ist heute in der Eremitage in St. Petersburg (Inv.-Nr. 742).
